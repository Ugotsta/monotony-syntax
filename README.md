# Monotony Syntax Theme for Atom

Stripped of all color, Monotony set out to show the world that style could be just as expressive with only shades of gray. It's the syntax theme that wants to decorate your code with subtle CSS effects like 2D transforms and soft blurs.

NOTES
* Markdown and some other languages are still a work-in-progress.

KNOWN BUGS
* use of text-shadows make it impossible to port to VS Code
* 'this' keyword is italicized which is just weird
* control structures like "if" and "return" stand out
* quote symbols surrounding strings are intentionally blurry
* comments are dark and blurry so they might not be so distracting
